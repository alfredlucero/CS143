Alfred Lucero handled most of the UI and design of the website in addition to creating
multiple pages to add movies/directors/actors to the database. Nicandro Vergara aided with searching,
showing actor/movie info., and adding reviews to the database. Also, we collaborated over github,
but we are still adapting to git and need to improve on using the shell to contribute to repositories
more efficiently. We ran into some struggles using the github UI as well as MySQL meticulous syntax for
submitting in queries. We worked incrementally and used echo statements to help with debugging our code
onto the php pages. Since we split up our movie website database amongst php pages, we were better able to
split up the work and maximize our efficiency.
